            <h1>Rules Governing the Use of the Resource Services</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                            All students and staff of the College are entitled to register as members of the Learning Resources and to use the
                            facilities of the Learning Resources for the purpose of their course of study or College employment.
                            
                            Membership may also be extended to other individuals and to persons nominated from other organisations: a fee is usually
                            charged. Access to the Learning Resources for study purposes may be made available to non-members by arrangement.
                            Details are available in the External Services leaflet.
                            
                            Use of Learning Resources facilities implies acceptance of the Learning Resources rules printed below. These are
                            designed to protect the interests of all users of Learning Resources and to ensure that the College operates within the
                            law and can carry out its functions efficiently and effectively. The Learning Resources rules apply in principle to all
                            Learning Resources sites, including workstation rooms and site libraries, notwithstanding some variations in practice in
                            the site libraries. Admission to the Learning Resources is conditional upon observation of the rules and the staff of
                            the Learning Resources are empowered to enforce them.
                            
                            Breaches of the rules may be dealt with by specific Learning Resources Disciplinary Action (see below), including the
                            withdrawal of some or all Learning Resources facilities, and if appropriate by invoking the College’s Regulations for
                            Students, in the case of students, or in the case of staff through the appropriate College procedures as set out in the
                            Staff Handbook.
            </p>

            <h2>Rules</h2>

            <h3>A. Access:</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                        <li>
                            i. The use of Learning Resources facilities is normally limited to use for the educational and other purposes of the
                            College.
                        </li>
                            
                        <li>
                            ii. All individuals wishing to become members of the Learning Resources must comply with the registration procedures.
                            These include an undertaking to abide by Learning Resources rules.
                        </li>
                            
                        <li>
                            iii. Individuals or organisations who are not eligible for membership but have good reason to use the Learning Resources
                            may be admitted, by arrangement, for purposes of study only. Procedures for seeking admission are outlined in the
                            External Services leaflet. Non-members must sign the Visitors' Book on each visit, and may be required to produce
                            written identification. Study use does not include access to the College's Academic Network.
                        </li>
                            
                        <li>
                            iv. ID cards issued by the College or Learning Resources are not transferable from one person to another. The person
                            named on each card is responsible for all items borrowed on it and is liable for the cost of replacement of the card or
                            items borrowed on it in the event of loss or damage.
                        </li>
                            
                        <li>
                            v. Users of the Learning Resources are reminded that they must be willing to show ID cards or other identification when
                            requested to do so by College staff.
                        </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>B. Use of Facilities</h3>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        i. The Learning Resources is not responsible for loss of, or damage to, the personal belongings of its users and
                        visitors. Users must take reasonable precautions against theft of their belongings, and must not leave belongings
                        unattended even for a very short period. Study tables/PCs may not be reserved by depositing clothing or private property
                        on the adjacent seat. Articles left unattended may be removed by Learning Resources staff but will be returned on
                        request at the Reception Desk.
                     </li>
                    <li>
                        ii. All users are required to conduct themselves quietly throughout the Learning Resources and conversation between
                        users must be kept to a minimum. No conversation is permitted in those parts of the Learning Resources designated as
                        ‘Silent’ areas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        iii. Personal stereos may not be used in the Learning Resources.
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        iv. Mobile phones must be turned off in all Learning Resources study areas. Their use is permitted in the enclosed stair
                        wells of the Main Site building. Circumstances at the Clinical Site Libraries may vary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        v. Users should not make use of mains electrical supplies to power their own equipment, including external storage
                        devices, unless the equipment has been tested and confirmed as meeting the required Health & Safety standards. Written
                        evidence of such compliance will be required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        vi. Eating and drinking are not permitted in any of the public areas of the Learning Resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        vii. Action will be taken against any person misusing furniture, facilities or materials. Any such person may be
                        required to pay for the making good damage or loss.
                    </li>
                </ul>
